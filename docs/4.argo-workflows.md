## argo workflows config

deployed using `helm` using the community [charts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/main/charts/argo-workflows) 
```sh
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
```

### vaules
update the vaules file to support
* ingress
    * local host
* authentication mode to `server` (this removes the need to authenticate when interacting with the UI) - only to be used for **developement/testing**, not ideal for production 


```yaml
server:

  extraArgs:
    - --auth-mode=server

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: "nginx"

    hosts:
      - argowf.local
```

### deployment
opted to use a controlled deployment with argocd instead of defined helm configuration in my argocd manifest

created k8s manifest with helm template command alongside my defined vaules

```sh
helm template argo-workflows argo/argo-workflows -f helm/argo-workflows.yaml --namespace argo --create-namespace > k8s-resources/argo-workflows/argo-workflows.yaml
```

defined a argocd application pointing to the new service
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: argo-worlflows
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
      repoURL: https://github.com/Matcham89/local-k8s.git 
      targetRevision: HEAD
      path: k8s-resources/argo-workflows
  destination:
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
      namespace: argo
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
    automated:
      selfHeal: true
      prune: true
```

### workflow authentication
first test workflow **failed**, again and again.

error:
```yaml
workflowtaskresults.argoproj.io is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:argo:argo-workflows-sa" cannot create resource "workflowtaskresults" in API group "argoproj.io" in the namespace "argo": RBAC: role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "argo-workflows-workflow-controller" not found
```

much googling later I found this [link](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/service-accounts/)

_In order for Argo to support features such as artifacts, outputs, access to secrets, etc. it needs to communicate with Kubernetes resources using the Kubernetes API. To communicate with the Kubernetes API, Argo uses a ServiceAccount to authenticate itself to the Kubernetes API. You can specify which Role (i.e. which permissions) the ServiceAccount that Argo uses by binding a Role to a ServiceAccount using a RoleBinding_

By default the nesscessary service account and permissions (in my case) were not present.

### option 1
grant the default ServiceAccount admin privileges (i.e., we will bind the admin Role to the default ServiceAccount of the current namespace):
```sh
kubectl create rolebinding default-admin --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=argo:default -n argo
```
note that this will grant admin privileges to the default ServiceAccount in the namespace that the command is run from, so you will only be able to run Workflows in the namespace where the RoleBinding was made.

this works but feels...wrong

### option 2
create the nesscessary serviceaccount, role, rolebinding.

adding addition manifest to the `k8s-resources/argo-workflows` directory created the service account with the permissions I wanted
as I wanted multiple namespace access, chose _**ClusterRole**_
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-sa
  namespace: argo
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-sa
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-sa-binding-argo
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: argo-workflows-sa
    namespace: argo
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: argo-workflows-sa-cluster-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-sa-binding-default
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: argo-workflows-sa
    namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: argo-workflows-sa-cluster-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: argo-workflows-sa-cluster-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
    resources:
      - "workflowtaskresults"
      - "workflows"
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch", "update", "patch", "delete"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - "pods"
      - "pods/log"
      - "secrets"
      - "configmaps"
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "delete"]
```

final step for ensuring the service is used as expected, is to define it **spec.serviceAccountName**
```yaml
spec:
  serviceAccountName: argo-workflows-sa
```
alternatively, can pass the service account details when triggering the workflow
```sh
argo submit --serviceaccount argo-workflows-sa argo-workflows/coin-toss.yaml
```
