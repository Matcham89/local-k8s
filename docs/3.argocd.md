## argocd config
deployed using the argocd [getting started](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/) and running on [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

```sh
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

since using the [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cloud provider for creating externalIP, opted to patch the argocd server to type `LoadBalancer`

```sh
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

connected to the UI by following the [getting started](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/) steps.

### deployment design
opted for an `_app of apps_` design

`argocd/services` directory containing the Argocd application manifests that point to the `k8s-resources` which have defined the Kubernetes manifest.

### repo config
connected to my `_public_` repo with through the UI - no access permission needed.

added branch controls to repo.

best practice is to store the application config and argocd deployment config in separate repo's, as this is only local dev single repo is okay.
